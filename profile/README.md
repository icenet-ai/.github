# IceNet: a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system

## What is IceNet?

IceNet is a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system developed by an [international team and led by British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4). IceNet was originally trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. The [library]((https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet) has now also been extended to facilitate daily resolution forecasting, as well as support further research into this subject. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss. 

In addition, several use cases and an ecosystem of service components have or are being developed under this organisation. 

For further information about the team involved, please look at the [project pages at BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/icenet/) or [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/artificial-intelligence-help-predict-arctic-sea-ice-loss). 

## How do I get started

To get started using the pipeline, please review the pinned repositories below, most likely you'll want to start with the [icenet library](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet/), [icenet-pipeline operational usage example](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-pipeline/) and/or [the icenet-notebooks repository which explains both CLI and programmatic usage](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/).
