# IceNet: a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system

## What is IceNet?

IceNet is a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system developed by an [international team and led by British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4). The [original IceNet research model](https://www.github.com/tom-andersson/icenet-paper) was trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. This IceNet model advanced the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. The IceNet model was made into [a library for operational forecasting](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet) and has now extends functionality to enable daily resolution forecasting, as well as to support further research efforts into the research area. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss. 

In addition, several use cases and an ecosystem of service components are contained within this organisation, supporting execution, analysis and research efforts. 

For further information about the team involved, please look at the [project pages at BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/icenet/) or [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/artificial-intelligence-help-predict-arctic-sea-ice-loss). 

## How do I get started

To get started using the pipeline, please review the pinned repositories below, most likely you'll want to start with the [icenet library](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet/), [icenet-pipeline operational usage example](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-pipeline/) and/or [the icenet-notebooks repository which explains both CLI and programmatic usage](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks/).
